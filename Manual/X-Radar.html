                <ul>
                    <li>This module has a vertical camera pointed at five objects. The objects are arranged in a regular
                        pentagon and are orbiting that pentagon's midpoint in front of the camera. The same part of each
                        object is alway facing the center of the orbit. Each object is also colored. The objects are
                        orbiting clockwise as seen from above.</li>
                    <li>The camera will only show a small vertical slice of an object at any time. The camera has a
                        perspective view, meaning that further away objects appear smaller in the camera view. The
                        camera will show differently angled faces as slightly different colors due to the lighting.</li>
                    <li>Also on the module are five buttons. Each of these buttons has a rotating 3d shape on it, and is
                        colored. To input an object, first press its shape, then press its color.</li>
                    <li>To solve the module, input the five objects in clockwise order as seen from above, starting
                        from the one whose shape and color appear on the same button.</li>
                    <li>Upon any incorrect submission, the module will immediately strike, and any previous inputs will
                        be reset. The solution will remain the same.</li>
